# The Hamburger Society


The Hamburger Society is a food themed website focused on creating a vibrant community of food enjoyers, specifically focused on finding the best hamburgers in the greater Zagreb area.

Users of the site will be able to connect with other members via our social media and if they sign up, they will also receive a concise monthly "foodletter" detailing excellent spots to find food in Zagreb.
